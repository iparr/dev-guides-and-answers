## On button text

[It's often better to name a button to explain what it does than to use a generic label (like "OK"). An explicit label serves as "just-in-time help," giving users more confidence in selecting the correct action.

["It is important for all buttons on a site to retain a certain level of consistency or else you risk confusing the users into trying to work out what is or isn’t a button."](http://inspectelement.com/tutorials/how-to-design-buttons-to-help-improve-usability/) - Tom Kenny


## On button placement

["Best place for a button?: aligned with left-hand end of text-boxes"](http://www.slideshare.net/cjforms/labels-and-buttons-on-forms) - Slide 36 - Jannet. Usability consultant

["The best place for your form’s submit button is exactly where the next input control would go.  Especially if you have a single-column input form, make sure that the submit button is aligned like all of your other elements."](http://howto.caspio.com/tech-tips/tech-tipoptimize-your-web-form-for-maximum-usability.html) - Caspio form builder

Place Important Content on the Left of a Web Page - ["People brought up in cultures where language is read and written from left to right have been trained early on in life to begin at the left of a page, whether in writing or reading a book. This can be the reason why many web users spend a majority of their attention on the left side of a web page — as much as 69% of the time"](http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/) - Six Revisions

Left or right aligned seems to be more common - [Smashing Magazine 'Modern forms' article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/04/17/web-form-design-modern-solutions-and-creative-ideas/)


## On arrows

["One of the most common uses of icons in buttons is to include an arrow to indicate that the button guides you to the **next or previous step** or page."](http://inspectelement.com/tutorials/how-to-design-buttons-to-help-improve-usability/) - Tom Kenny
